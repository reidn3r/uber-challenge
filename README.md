Github, Bitbucket...).
---------------

### Food Trucks

Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found
near a specific location on a map.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food
Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat)

Technical spec
--------------

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for
instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other
technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is
respected.

2. **Back-end track**: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API
   docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other
   services.

### Back-end

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about
using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.
Therefore, feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have
with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing
your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Go
* C++
* Haskell
* Java

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework
that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

Host it!
--------
When you‚Äôre done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).
